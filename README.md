# clawMachineFPGA
Developed as part of a Waterloo class project this is a FPGA design for a Claw Machine to move to a specified set of coordinates and then drop a claw to pick up objects.

## State Dyagrams:

### XY Motion
This machine controls XY motion.

### Extender
This machine controls the arm that extends the claw down.
